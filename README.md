# My 1st attempt at a Youtube clone

### Feb 2021

Finished with the main part of the design for the Youtube clone and going to leave it here as I think I took away most of the lessons I was supposed to learn with this project, which was to learn about embedding videos. OVerall I think it's pretty close, I kept fonts default and didn't try and match font sizing perfectly. I think my main area to improve next would be to align the top of the videos in the sidebar with the top of the main video. I also have a messy code structure so should work on keeping that more organized.

Defitely a good learning experience with trying to copy another design from scratch. I may revisit this in the future with more knowledge and experience and see if I can make it better.
